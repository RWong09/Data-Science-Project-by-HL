# Data Science Project: District Living Recommendation System

Welcome to the Malaysia district living recommendation system, a project powered by a data science student in University of Malaysia for his data science project.

This project is to ensure that the users can get some valuable insights on choosing the best districts/area to live and work in Malaysia based on their preferences on job and house rental.

Future ideas, collaboration and sponsor is welcomed and you can contact to: **hoongliang03@gmail.com**
